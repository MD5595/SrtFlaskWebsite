    <h1>Unit 4.1: While Loops</h1>

    <p>Like conditionals, loops check a statement and perform an action depending on if the statement is true or not.</p>

    <p>While loops check a condition and continuously perform an action as long as the condition is fulfilled.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    <p>While x > 29:</p>
    <p>    print("x is greater than 29")</p>
    <p>    x += 1</p>
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>While loops are generally used when you do not know how many iterations your statement will have.</p>
</body>
    </div>
