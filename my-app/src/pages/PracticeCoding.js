        <p><b>Unit 1: Introduction </b><br/>
        1) Make a program that contains 4 variables. There should be a int, float, string, and true
            <br/> <br/>
            2) Make a program that asks the user for their age. Cast the variable that had
            the input assigned to it as a float, then print it.
            <br/>
            3) Make a program that has 2 variables that contain different numbers.
            Utilize an f-string to print out these numbers with the sentence, "The numbers __ and __ are awesome"
            <br/>
        </p><br/>
        <p><b>Unit 2: Math</b>
        <br/>
            1) Write a program that utilizes a function to calculate the area on a circle with a radius of 4.
           <br/>
            2) Assign -4.25 to a variable, and use an imported function to make the variable's value -4. Use
            another function to make the variable's value 4.
            <br/>
            3) Write a Python program to convert radians to degrees. <br/>
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 3: Conditional</b>
            <br/>
1) Make a program that asks the user for their age. If they are 15, have the program "You are allowed to enter" If the user inputs a number other than 15,
            have the program print "You are not allowed to enter".<br/>
            2) Make a program that first asks the user to input their name and grade. Next write an else if statement that prints, "Welcome, {the inputted username}"
          if the name is not John or Sam, and "You are not welcome" if the inputted grade is greater than or equal to 10.   
            3)
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 4: Loops </b><br/>

        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 5: Functions</b><br/>
1) Create a function that has 2 parameters. If the remainder <br/>
          2) Create a program that allows the user to input 4 numbers. Include a function named largest_abs_val with 4 parameters that 
          returns the number with the largest absolute value. Call the function the function and have the 4 inputted values be used in the function
            1) Create a function that has one parameter, and 
        </p>
        <p><b>.Unit 6: Lists</b><br/>
1) Create a list that contains one value of each datatype.<br/>
            2) Create a list that contains 4 values. Have the 3rd index of the list be printed.<br/>
            3) Write a function that replaces the 4th index of a list with a random value between 0 and 50.<br/>
            4) Write a function that reverses the order of a list's contents.<br/>
            5) Write a function that lowercases the first and last strings in a list. <br/>
        </p>
