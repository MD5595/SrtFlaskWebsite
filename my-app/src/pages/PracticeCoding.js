        <p><b>Unit 1: Introduction </b><br/>
        1) Make a program that contains 4 variables. There should be a int, float, string, and true
            <br/> <br/>
            2) Make a program that asks the user for their age. Cast the variable that had
            the input assigned to it as a float, then print it.
            <br/>
            3) Make a program that has 2 variables that contain different numbers.
            Utilize an f-string to print out these numbers with the sentence, "The numbers __ and __ are awesome"
            <br/>
        </p><br/>
        <p><b>Unit 2: Math</b>
        <br/>
            1) Write a program that utilizes a function to calculate the area on a circle with a radius of 4.
           <br/>
            2) Assign -4.25 to a variable, and use an imported function to make the variable's value -4. Use
            another function to make the variable's value 4.
            <br/>
            3) Write a Python program to convert radians to degrees. <br/>
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 3: Conditional</b>
            <br/>
1) Make a program that asks the user for their age. If they are 15, have the program "You are allowed to enter" If the user inputs a number other than 15,
            have the program print "You are not allowed to enter".<br/>
            2) Make a program that first asks the user to input their name and grade. Next write an else if statement that prints, "Welcome, {the inputted username}"
          if the name is not John or Sam, and "You are not welcome" if the inputted grade is greater than or equal to 10.   
            3)
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 4: Loops </b><br/>

        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 5: Functions</b><br/>
1) Create a function that has 2 parameters. If the remainder <br/>
          2) Create a program that allows the user to input 4 numbers. Include a function named largest_abs_val with 4 parameters that 
          returns the number with the largest absolute value. Call the function the function and have the 4 inputted values be used in the function
            1) Create a function that has one parameter, and 
        </p>
        <p><b>.Unit 6: Lists</b><br/>
1) Create a list that contains one value of each datatype.<br/>
            2) Create a list that contains 4 values. Have the 3rd index of the list be printed.<br/>
            3) Write a function that replaces the 4th index of a list with a random value between 0 and 50.<br/>
            4) Write a function that reverses the order of a list's contents.<br/>
            5) Write a function that lowercases the first and last strings in a list. <br/>
            6 Create an empty list, then make a for loop that adds 10 random numbers to the list that are between 1 and 200. Include an if else statement at the end of the program that prints "Nice!" if the remainder 
            of the first two values is greater the reminder of the 
            if more than 39, and "Not nice!" in any other situtation. <br/>
