    <h1>Unit 3.2: Else-if Statements</h1>

    <p>The more complicated version of if-else statements are else-if statements, which have 2 or more statements. Below is a program that utilizes the else-if statements.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
Name = input("Enter your name")

if Name == "Tom":
    print("Hi")
elif Name == "John":
    print("Hi John")
elif Name == "June":
    print("Hi June")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Any number of conditions can be placed within if/elif statements, and there can be any number of elif statements within one conditional. Some else-if and if statements have no "else" statement, meaning if none of the above conditions are met, nothing will happen.</p>

    <p>Remember that you can place anything within if statements, including more if statements and conditionals.</p>
