    <h1>1.1 Hello World.</h1>

    <p>What is Python? Python is a programming language that is used for a variety of purposes such as automation of tasks,
        data analysis, and website creation. Python is known for its simplicity (writing code in Python is often like
        writing in plain English) and is often the recommended first language for beginners. You will most likely find
        many of Python's features to be intuitive and straightforward to implement.</p>

    <p>Here is a simple program.</p>
    <code>#Prints Hello world
print("Hello World!")</code>

    <p>Python code like this can be created in an IDE or a code editor. For this course, the PyCharm IDE will be used.</p>

    <p>In the program above there are three components; The comment, the <code>print()</code> function, and the text within
        it. By putting this code into a text editor and running it, the following code will be outputted to the console.</p>

    <pre>Hello World!</pre>

    <p>The comment on the first line is not read by the computer due to the #. Comments are used when you want to note a
        piece of information within your code.</p>

    <p>Now that you understand the basics of the “Hello World!” program, we will go over how to properly set up Python
        programs.</p>
