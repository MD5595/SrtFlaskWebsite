    <h1>1.1 Hello World</h1>
    <p><strong>What is Python?</strong> Python is a programming language that is used for a variety of purposes such as automation of tasks, data analysis, and website creation. Python is known for its simplicity; writing code in Python is often like writing in plain English. It is often recommended as the first programming language for beginners. Many of Python's features are intuitive and straightforward to implement.</p>

    <p>Here is a simple program:</p>
    <pre>
# Prints "Hello world"
print("Hello World!")
    </pre>

    <p>Python code like this can be created in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor. For this course, the PyCharm IDE will be used.</p>

    <p>In the program above, there are three components: the comment, the `print()` function, and the text within it. By putting this code into a text editor and running it, the following code will be outputted to the console:</p>
    <pre>
Hello World!
    </pre>

    <p>The comment on the first line is not read by the computer due to the `#`. Comments are used when you want to note a piece of information within your code.</p>

    <p>Now that you understand the basics of the “Hello World!” program, we will
        go over how to properly set up Python programs.</p>
