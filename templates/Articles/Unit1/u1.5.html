    <h1>Unit 1.5: Data Types</h1>
    <p>In Unit 1.3 you briefly got introduced to data types, which dictate what operations/actions can be performed on a
        variable.</p>

    <p>In some programming languages, you must specify what data type a variable is when you declare it, however in Python
        the type is automatically determined based on what value you give the variable.</p>

    <p>Here are all the data types that this course will go over:</p>


    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Data Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Text type</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Integer, float</td>
            <td>Number type</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>List</td>
            <td>Sequence type</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>Boolean type</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <p>Strings are any text that get surrounded by quotation marks. Numbers, letters, words, and symbols all can be
        strings.</p>
    <p>Integers are any whole numbers, while floats are numbers with decimals.</p>
    <p>A list is a group of values stored within one variable.</p>
    <p>A boolean is either true or false.</p>

    <p>Below are some examples.</p>

    <pre>
Tree = "Oak"
Number1 = 13
Float1 = 3.2838
List1 = ["Iphone", "Android", "Google Pixel"]
Boolean1 = 3 > 8
    </pre>

    <p>Different data types can be used in different statements. For example, integers, floats, and strings can be added to
        variables of the same data type but booleans canâ€™t. Also, you can only use the modulus operator with the int and
        float data types.</p>
